// Package transport provides a flavor-agnostic HTTP layer: a thin client that
// applies request decorators (auth, user-agent) and retries transient failures.
//
// This package backs the wecom-calendar-cli command layer and is also
// importable as a library; see the repository README. The CLI relies on its
// retry, timeout and decorator behavior; change it additively and keep the
// defaults stable rather than tuning them for a single local call site.

// Doer executes an HTTP request. *http.Client satisfies it; tests inject fakes.

// Decorator mutates an outgoing request before it is sent (e.g. adds headers).
